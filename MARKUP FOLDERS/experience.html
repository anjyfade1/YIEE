Implementing ETL pipelines using Spark and Hadoop so that our partner teams can consume data. Our analytics help in prioritization of alerts and increase fidelity of detections.

                            I worked with Facebook AI Research for a few months to assist in their efforts to detect hoax news and bot-generated fake news on their platform. I was advised by Prof. Hany Farid from Berkeley and Dr. Ser-Nam Lim from Facebook.

                            <li>
                               <b>Fake News Detection:</b> I leveraged advanced language models to contribute an open source dataset consisting of 100k AI-generated news articles. I then explored a variety of semantic (function words, readability) and textual features (word embeddings, contextual embeddings) for classification. Applied classifiers such as SVM, Random Forest, Regression and deep neural networks and anomaly detection methods such as autoencoders to identify AI generated content. Our results show that AI generated text can be detected with high F-1 scores of over 90%.

                               <b>Zero Shot Learning for Misinformation:</b> Misinformation is a constantly changing, ever-evolving space. We designed a novel embedding space to detect new classes of fake news. We applied topic modeling and out-of-distribution detection algorithms to identify novel fake news categories.
